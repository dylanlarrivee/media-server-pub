# Node mediaServer - Server App

A client and server app that allows users to stream media from their home computer from anywhere with internet access through a secure sign in portal. Also allows the uses of streaming legal torrents from magnet URIs.

You can set the server app running on your desktop computer pointed to your media file and then log in with the client app and view those media files from where ever you are as long as you have a working internet connection.

The apps are connected with a postgres database that you need to configure and then connect in the .ENV file. For my personal use I am using the free tier RDMS on AWS.

## Technologies used:
Node.js, Express, PostgreSQl, JavaScript, Vue.js, AWS

Note: I am still in the process of updating to the new html layout. I was concentrating on making it work first before making it pretty.
